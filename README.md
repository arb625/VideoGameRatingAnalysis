# VideoGameRatingAnalysis
A script that plots the user scores vs. critic scores for the Metacritic video game ratings obtained from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) and performs linear regression to observe the relationship between these scores. It also does similar regression analysis for the relationship between user scores and global sales of these games. Finally, it performs mean analysis on the ratings grouped on various features of the games such as genre and platform.

Uses [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
